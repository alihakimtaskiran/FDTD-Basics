# FDTD-Basics

FDTD is a numerical method solving Maxwell's equations in time domain. The underlying principle is approximating the space as a grid, named as Yee Grid, and assigning E and H field parameters for each grid. In addition to this, Maxwell's equatÄ±ons are expressed in discrete form by linear approximation.
